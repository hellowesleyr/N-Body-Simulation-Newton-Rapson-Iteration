<h1>N-Body-Simulation</h1>

<p>This is an N-Body simulation of Argon atoms in a small box. It was created and tested by recreating relationships within thermal physics. The forces between atoms are modelled according to the Lennard Jones potential.</p>

<p>Particle energy and pressure exerted on the box were calculated to test thermal physics relationships.</p>

<p>Below is a short gif demonstrating the simulation visualisation accomplished with matplotlib.</p>
